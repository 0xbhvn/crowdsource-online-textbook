# Crowdsourced Online Textbook

## The Problem
In the current scenario, university textbooks are written by a single author, which limits the amount of knowledge that goes into that book to a single brain. So if an author has expertise over 3 modules out 10, they generally write the whole book and publish it. The problem with this method is that students don't get expert knowledge throughout the book.

## The Solution
Our solution proposes that university syllabus should be made like a *Wikibook*. Anyone who's registered user of the website can contribute to the book/module/topic/subtopic. There'll be a team of moderators who would look for the quality of course content and update it accordingly. Those who contributed will be credited for their contribution.

## Future Scope
There can be limitless contributions for a particular topic. For university moderators - alone - to handle all these contributions will be next to impossible. For that we can create a system, where a particular user will be awarded certain points for his contribution (may it be course content, suggestions, reports or whatever), and after having some decided points that user will be made a moderator for that particular topic.
